Telepresence Robot
==================

After seeing a commercial for a Telepresence robot on TV, I knew I wanted to play with one, but after looking at prices I didn't want to pay for one.

I used an Android Nexus 7 tablet for the video conferencing. A custom PCB with an STM32 ARM processor and an FTDI USB chip to connect the Android tablet with the motors.
